<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I started this blog to document my journey into IT. As I learn and create projects I hope to share them with others and future employers to demonstrate my skill set.

Currently I am studying full time to obtain my Cert IV in Information Technology (Networking). 

Other certifications I am aiming to towards are;

* Comptia A+
* AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate
* CCNA
* Linus RHCSA
* Phython
